# NodeProject
The principal file here is "NodeProject.r"- my motivation here was to compare two Best Of the 20th C. lists-- one created by the critics of The Modern Library, and the other the best 100 books of the 20th century as chosen by the users of Goodreads. There were some interesting intersections here-- look into "results.csv" and see for yourself...
